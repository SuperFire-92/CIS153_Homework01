 Point of Sale

This program allows a user to add a combination of 6 different items to a
cart, and "purchase" them. There are two buttons for each item, one to add
one to the cart, and another to remove one from the cart. There is a display
on each item showing how many are currently in the cart. On the right side,
there is a receipt of the current order, showing the date, time, and order
number of when the order was started. Beneath that, there is a list of each
item, how many of that item there is, and the price of that item. At the
bottom, there is the subtotal, the tax, and the final total, along with
a button to start a new order.
